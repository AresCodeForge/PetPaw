# Hero Video

Place your hero video here with the filename: `hero-pets.mp4`

## Requirements

- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended for best compatibility)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher recommended
- **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 works best
- **Duration**: 5-15 seconds (will loop seamlessly)
- **File size**: Keep under 10MB for fast loading

## Recommended content

- Cute pets playing, running, or interacting
- Colorful, vibrant footage
- Avoid text overlays (the video shows through the logo text)

## Fallback

If no video is provided, a beautiful animated gradient will display instead.

You can also add a fallback image at `/public/images/hero-fallback.jpg`
